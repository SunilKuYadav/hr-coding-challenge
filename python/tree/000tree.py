# What is the Binary Tree?
# Ans. Binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

"""
# A Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node of the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL.
""" 

"""
# Binary Tree node contains the following parts:
    1. Data
    2. Pointer to left child
    3. Pointer to right child
# Basic Operation On Binary Tree:
    1. Inserting an element.
    2. Removing an element.
    3. Searching for an element.
    4. Traversing an element.
# Auxiliary Operation On Binary Tree:
    1. Finding the height of the tree.
    2. Find the level of the tree.
    3. Finding the size of the entire tree.
